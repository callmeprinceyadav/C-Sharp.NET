Section 1: Basic Questions


1. What are the different types of loops in C#?
Ans - C# supports several types of loops:
    for loop
    while loop
    do-while loop
    foreach loop

2. Explain the syntax and working of the for loop in C#.
Ans - Syntax and Working of the for loop:

Syntax:
csharp
Copy
Edit
for (initialization; condition; iteration)
{
    // loop body
}
Explanation: The for loop initializes a variable, checks a condition, executes the loop body, and iterates until the condition is false.


3. How does a while loop work?
Ans - How a while loop works:

    Syntax:
    csharp
    Copy
    Edit
    while (condition)
    {
        // loop body
    }
    Explanation: The while loop executes its body as long as the condition remains true.


4. What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
Ans - The main difference is that a while loop checks the condition before executing the loop body, 
      while a do-while loop checks the condition after executing the loop body at least once.

5. What happens if the loop condition in a while loop is initially false?
Ans - If the condition is false initially, the loop body will never execute, 
      and the program will continue with the code following the loop.

6. How do you use a foreach loop in C#?
Ans - Syntax:
    csharp
    Copy
    Edit
    foreach (var item in collection)
    {
        // loop body
    }
    Explanation: The foreach loop iterates over each element 
    in a collection (like arrays, lists, etc.) without explicitly using an index.

7. Can we modify elements inside a foreach loop? Why or why not?
Ans - Elements cannot be modified directly inside a foreach loop because it iterates over the collection using an iterator, 
      and modifying the collection itself isn't allowed during iteration.
